# Dynamic-Multilevel-Indexing-using-B-Tree-For-Big-Data-Drive
# Dynamic Multilevel Indexing was done using B-Tree to implement a dictionary containing words and their meaning. Here the key was our word.
  B-Tree provided fast retrieval of data from the Secondary Memory. The data address being generated in binary was of 32-bit to keep the size of
  dictionary sufficiently large. The whole code was written in C language.
